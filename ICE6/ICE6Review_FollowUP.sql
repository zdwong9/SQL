##### Below are my corrected queries for qn Q,R, S,T

###############################################################3
# q: For each course offered in semester I-2001, return CID and the maximum Finalmark. Note,
# Finalmark of a student corresponding to a course refers to the accumulated mark of studentâ€™s
# performance in various assessments.

#step 1: get final mark
select sid,cid, sum(mark*weight) from performance p inner join assessment a on p.aid=a.aid
group by sid,cid;

#step 2:get cid and final mark for each course in sem I-2001
select sid,cid, sum(mark*weight) as finalmark from performance p inner join assessment a 
on p.aid=a.aid and cid in (select cid from registration where semester='i-2001')
group by sid,cid;
select * from performance p;
#baihua: the condition cin in () listed in Line 256 is not correct.
#you should use the condition: (cid, sid) in (select cid, sid from registration where semester='I-2001'). Why?

#######Corrected
#step 2:get cid and final mark for each course in sem I-2001

on p.aid=a.aid and (cid,sid) in (select cid,sid from registration where semester='i-2001')
group by sid,cid;
select * from performance p;


# step 3: get max final mark for each course
select cid,max(finalmark) from (select sid,cid, sum(mark*weight) as finalmark from performance p inner join assessment a 
on p.aid=a.aid and (sid,cid) in (select sid,cid from registration where semester='i-2001')
